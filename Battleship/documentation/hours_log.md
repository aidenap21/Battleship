9/9 4 hours (roughly, I wasn't paying attention because I didn't realize we needed to track it at the time.)
- Got the base of the game set up. I created the Game and Player class as well as the GameObject parent class. I have the skeleton ready for the actual game to be created. Almost finished the setup phase where players hide their ships, but there was a weird bug, so I went to bed.

9/10 2 hours
- Mostly work on the Github repo, but a little more coding. Added documentation folder, organized project requirements into a Github issue.
