9/9 4 hours (roughly, I wasn't paying attention because I didn't realize we needed to track it at the time.)
```
- Got the base of the game set up. I created the Game and Player class as well as the GameObject parent class. I have the skeleton ready for the actual game to be created. Almost finished the setup phase where players hide their ships, but there was a weird bug, so I went to bed.
```

9/10 2 hours
```
- Mostly work on the Github repo, but a little more coding. Added documentation folder, organized project requirements into a Github issue.
```
  Probably about 3 more hours
```
- I did tid bits between the last chunk of time and this chunk
- Peter resolved a bug that was holding me back and I begain implementing the ability to orient your ships when you place down 1xN ships where N > 1.

9/11 4 Hours

- Met with Pete and helped do some work on his part. I then refactored the whole repo for several hours. The main work that was done was changing the board to be more dynamic by including the new Tile and Ship class on the board, instead of just regular strings. I also refactored the hiding mechanics to be transactional and only accept transactions where all the coords the ship is attempting to be placed on are valid. This prevents a ship from being overlapped or going off the board. I actually just realized there's a bug where the initial placement can overlap a ship. Oops. I'll have to fix that tomorrow.

- 9/11 spent about 2 hours familarizing myself with the repo then beggining to add to my section of work. Then met with jaxon to get his help with navigating the repo and refractoring the board bulid.
